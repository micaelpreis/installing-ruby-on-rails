### Tutorial - How To Install Ruby On Rails On Mac

In this tutorial you are going to learn how to install Ruby On Rails on Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan. 

To do so, just follow the steps below.

### 1. Installing Homebrew

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is a package manager for OS X that allows you to install useful packages. 

To install it you need to have installed on you mac, the apple program Xcode and to have said 'Yes' when you were asked if you wanted to install Command Line Developer Tools. 

After you have installed Xcode, you just need to run your Terminal the following command.

 	ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

**Note:** In case you have installed Xcode without Command Line Developer Tools, you can run the following command on Terminal, and an alert box will pop-up asking you if you want to install it.

   	xcode-select --install
